In this workshop, I learned how to manage dynamic memory for arrays in a class by
using pointers with new and delete[]. I implemented the Rule of Three by writing
a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator to properly handle
copying and cleanup of dynamic data. This helped me understand why these special
functions are important to avoid memory problems.

I also learned how to read data from files by counting the number of entries first,
then loading the numbers into a dynamically allocated array. I practiced adding
new elements to the array by resizing it and copying existing data over, then
sorting the array to keep the numbers in order.

Another thing I worked on was overloading operators, especially += to add numbers,
and writing a display function that outputs the numbers with formatted precision,
without using iomanip.

One challenge I faced was ensuring that my copy constructor and assignment operator
worked correctly to avoid shallow copy issues. It took some trial and error to get
memory management right and avoid leaks or crashes.

Overall, this workshop gave me good practice with dynamic arrays, file I/O, operator
overloading, and writing safe copy logic in C++.
