I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Reflection:

In workshop 1, I learned how to split my program into modules and 
effectively organize my functions. I also learned what goes in 
header files and what doesn't. I learned best practices for 
modular programming and code organization. I learned how 
namespaces work, using namespaces helps avoiding name conflicts 
as our program grows. 
    We were asked to put all our code except the main function in 
seneca namespace, if I put the main function in seneca namespace, 
the program wouldn't run. That's because main is a special function 
that needs to be in global scope for the compiler to access it.
    Another thing I learned is, even though it takes a little extra 
effort to make separate files to organize code in modules, it is 
very helpful in the long run. It makes the program easier to read, 
understand, debug and modify. Rather than having one very long file 
with all the functions, it is better to divide it into multiple 
modules, and having functions that perform similar functions in the 
same file. For example, "File.cpp" contains all the code about file 
handling in the program.
    One of the issues i ran into while working on this workshop was 
ShoppingRec being undefined type in some files, I thought it would be 
enough to add the header file that contained it's definition in 
ShoppingRec.cpp, but soon I realized I need to include the header file 
in all the files it's being used in. Especially with "File.h", I had 
never included a header file in another header file, I didn't know if 
that was possible. But I figured it out and used header files correctly 
in all my code.
