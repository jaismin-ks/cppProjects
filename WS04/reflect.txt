I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


In the process of doing this workshop, I improved my skills in using 
constructors, destructors, and delegated constructors. I also used 
member functions, and dynamic memory allocation for array of Labels, 
and also for character array for content.
I also learned more about how to format my output correctly, by using fill 
and width in the print function. I also learned that I can use cout << ""; 
to manually trigger width and fill I set beforehand, to ensure it gets 
applied properly.
I had some trouble in formatting the label frame correctly, since the 
frame had to be made in a very specific order, so every time I used a cout, 
I had to make sure I was using the right index for m_frame, it took me a 
couple tries, but I drew it on paper and it made more sense. I also had a 
little confusion Label::Label(const char* frame, const char* content) function. 
But I understood I needed to make a dynamically allocated array of 71 characters, 
up to 70 chars that could be printed, and one last space for null terminator. I was 
using 71 for length of array, but this confused me when it came to using indexes, 
since they start from 0. But i figured it out in the end.
