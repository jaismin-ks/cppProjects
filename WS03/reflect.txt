I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Reflection:

In Workshop 3, I practiced my skills of modular programming, 
object-oriented design, and dynamic memory management in C++. 
Splitting the program into separate modules, such as Food.cpp 
and CalorieList.cpp, helped organize my code clearly. 
For example, all the food-related logic including validation 
and display is inside the Food class, while the CalorieList 
class manages the collection of foods dynamically. 
This made my code easier to read and maintain.

One important thing I learned was how to manage dynamic arrays 
of objects safely using pointers. In CalorieList::init(int capacity), 
I used new to allocate an array of Food objects, and in 
CalorieList::reset(), I freed the memory with delete[] to 
avoid memory leaks. 

A challenge I faced was figuring out how to handle invalid food 
items when showing the list. The program needed to mark those 
invalid items clearly, but only add up and show the total calories 
if everything was valid. I solved this by carefully checking which 
items were valid and making sure the total calories only included 
those. This helped make the output look right and meet the requirements.

This workshop helped me learn how to organize my code better and work 
with classes and memory. A big part of the process was debugging my 
program by running it many times and comparing the output to the sample 
output file. This helped me find formatting errors and fix them so my 
programâ€™s output matched exactly what was expected.
