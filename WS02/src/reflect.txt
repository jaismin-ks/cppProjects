I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Reflection:
In this project, I learned how to effectively manage dynamic 
memory with pointers, especially when dealing with arrays of 
structs. I learned how to use new and delete[] to avoid memory 
leaks, and how to check for memory leaks. I learned how to 
manually handle dynamically allocated memory, and that 
we need to free it at the end of the program. 

I also learned how function overloading and default parameters 
work in C++, which helped simplify the display function for 
different use cases. I also learned how to handle references in 
function parameters.

One challenge I faced was ensuring that all allocated memory was 
properly deallocated in the cleanUp function. I realized I had 
to delete each postalCode string individually with a loop before 
deleting the array of Region structs. Initially, I missed deleting 
the inner pointers, which would have caused leaks.

Overall, I learned more about working wiht pointers, 
dynamic memory, and modular programming in C++.
